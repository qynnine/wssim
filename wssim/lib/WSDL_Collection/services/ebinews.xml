      <title>The 1000 Genomes Project Pilot Phase Complete</title>
      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/press_releases.html#a_646</link>
      <description>The 1000 Genomes Project, a major international
                collaboration to build a detailed map of human genetic variation, has
                completed its pilot phase. The results are now published in the journal
                Nature and freely available through the EBI. The study provides valuable
                insights into the nature of human genetic variation and will underpin the
                next phase of human genetic research.

      <description>A paper in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology released online today finally ends speculation on whether a protein involved in splicing regulation functions as a repressor or facilitator of splicing. It does both! The study, authored by researchers from EMBL-EBI, Cambridge and Slovenia, used a new high-resolution technique to pinpoint the precise transcript binding positions of the protein... more</description>

      <description>Today's publication in Nature of the genetic blueprint for the
zebra finch marks 10 years of success for the Ensembl project in helping
researchers to navigate the genomes of a Noah's Ark of species. Ensembl,
a genome annotation system co-developed and jointly run by EMBL-EBI and
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, played a major part in finding the
genes and other functionally important features in the zebra finch
genome... more</description>

      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/press_releases.html#a_587</link>
      <description>A Science paper released today uncovers the role of variation in chromatin structure on gene regulation and the heritability of these differences. The study, authored by researchers from EMBL-EBI and several USA research institutes, used data from the 1000 Genomes Project to compare chromatin structure at regulatory sites in the genome not only between individuals but also within an individual. Humans typically contain two copies of every gene but these copies can be expressed differently... more</description>

      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/news.html#a_575</link>
      <description>For the first time in a higher eukaryote, researchers at EMBL-EBI and 
their collaborators have demonstrated that the binding of nuclear pore 
components to large parts of the Drosophila genome is an additional 
mechanism involved in regulating gene expression. As published today in 
PLoS Genetics, the researchers identified two nucleoporins, Mtor and 
Nup153, that bind a quarter of the Drosophila genome at active 
chromosomal regions and define a major class of new proteins regulating 
gene expression... more</description>

      <title>InterPro release 25.0</title>
      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/database_releases.html#a_574</link>
      <description>New features include: This release contains 1312 new methods, which include new methods from HAMAP (280509), Pfam (24.0), PIRSF (2.71) and TIGRFAMs (9.0). Please Note: Pfam release 24.0 matches were calculated using HMMER3. The majority of the updated signatures were stable; however some had significant increases or decreases in the numbers of proteins they matched (+/- 30% change), which changed the taxonomy and/or biology based on protein matches. We are reviewing these entries, checking that the InterPro entry annotation is still valid and reflects the taxonomy and biology of the proteins matched by the Pfam signatures. Those Pfam signatures which have not yet been through this review process were therefore temporarily removed from InterPro and will be re-integrated into the InterPro database during 2010. If you have any questions about this, please contact us via support. For full details of the release please see the Release Notes.</description>

      <title>Launch of the first standard graphical notation for biology</title>
      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/news.html#a_524</link>
      <description>EBI researchers and their colleagues in 30 labs worldwide have released a new set of standards for graphically representing biological information. This visual language should make it easier to exchange complex information, so that models are accurate, efficient and readily understandable. The new standard, called the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), is published today in Nature Biotechnology... more</description>

      <title>Sweden is the first country to pledge long-term funding for ELIXIR</title>
      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/news.html#a_501</link>
      <description>The Swedish funding agencies (the Swedish Energy Agency, Fas, Formas, the Swedish Research Council and VINNOVA) have suggested the government to allocate a total of 19 million SEK (1.7 million Euro) over three years to ELIXIR and the Swedish Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences (BILS), which would make Sweden the first country to secure long-term funding for ELIXIR. The Swedish government has expressed its intention to substantially increase research funding in several strategic areas, including national infrastructures, and a final decision along these lines is expected during the autumn 2009. Bioinformatics is increasingly important in the interpretation of these data. We are therefore very enthusiastic about this new long-term funding for the BILS bioinformatics infrastructure in Sweden, which works within a European perspective and interacts closely with ELIXIR"... more</description>

      <link>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/News/news.html#a_450</link>
      <description>A genome wide study of transcription in yeast has 
redefined the concept of promoters. Researchers in the groups of Lars 
Steinmetz at EMBL in Heidelberg, Germany, and Wolfgang Huber at EMBL-EBI 
in Hinxton, UK, have unravelled how yeast generates its transcripts and 
have come a step closer to understanding their function. The study is 
published online in the current issue of Nature... more</description>

      <description>In an article published in Genome Research, scientists from the 
EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute have uncovered how metabolic 
protein production is regulated in the model bacterium E.coli, and how 
similar proteins have evolved in other bacteria. The ability to modify 
the metabolic system is important for bacteria to be able to respond to 
changes in nutrient availability... more
